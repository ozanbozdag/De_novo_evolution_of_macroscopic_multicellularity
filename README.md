# This readme file presents the information about the source data used to generate plots in our manuscript entitled "De_novo_evolution_of_macroscopic_multicellularity"
# 01 Raw data: multicellular size (Fig1C&D, FigS1)
# 02 Raw data: cellular aspect ratio (Fig2D&E, FigS3)
# 03 Supplementary information: de novo variants detected through Illumina Sequencing (Fig4A&B) - this is a combined list of all variants in anaerobic strains converted from separate VCF files
# 04 dN/dS
