# Source/raw data used to generate plots in "De_novo_evolution_of_macroscopic_multicellularity" manuscript
# 01 Raw data: multicellular size (Fig1C&D, FigS1)
# 02 Raw data: cellular aspect ratio (Fig2D&E, FigS3)
# 03 Supplementary information: de novo variants detected through Illumina Sequencing (Fig4A&B) - this is a combined list of all variants in anaerobic strains converted from separate VCF files
# 04 dN/dS  
# 05 Python script used to calculate weighted biomass means (average multicellular size in Fig1D)
