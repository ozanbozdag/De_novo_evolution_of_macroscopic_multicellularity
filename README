Raw data and source code used to generate plots in "De_novo_evolution_of_macroscopic_multicellularity" manuscript

File # 01_A Raw data: Multicellular size in micron radius of the crosssectional area (Fig1C&D, FigS1) 
#(We used 05_Source_Code_01 to calculate the average multicellular size which generates averages by weighting size distribution by cluster biomass)

File # 01_B Average multicellular size weighted by cluster biomass (Fig3D, FigS1, FigS2)

File # 02 Raw data: Cellular aspect ratio (Fig2D&E, FigS3)

File # 03 Raw data: Multicellular size of genetically engineered mutant snowflake yeast (Fig4D)

File # 04 Supplementary Information: De novo variants detected by Illumina Sequencing (Fig4)

File # 05 Source code: Python script to calculate weighted biomass means (average multicellular size in Fig1D)
